# Simple-Python-flask-code
This code is part of our activity. It shows here how html file or webpage works under flask (Python Framework for web development) just like PHP.  


## SET UP
### TO RUN THIS PROGRAM:

1. go to your cmd and then enter this command : 'pip install flask' in your directory
   #### note: if you are using an IDE, just go the the terminal and enter the command

2. Make a python folder/directory and paste the content of 'pythonproject2'(You can use my folder directly ;), we are just trying to be more organized on our code.)
   #### note: You can notice that we have our separate folder for html file it is because that's how it should be. You need to separate each of your files into different folders based on its file extension it is for the flask read your files (ex : images folder for image, css for css files, and so on) you can also install virtual environment, it will provide a better file structures and directory. just type the command: pip install venv
   

## RUN

## ALL DONE

That's it, I hope this sample flask program will help you to have an idea on how python flask works as a backend programming language.
Kepp on motivating yourself, keep on practicising, keep on learning. 

### See you around on my next sample projects, peace!!
